Hello everyone, and future Hannan. This project is meant to be a fun one with a little more challenge than the static blog website. Essentially a prototype of the react native app you have going on, but on web which is easier for you to do.

You should create an outline soon on what to do, so you don't get lost and burn out like you always do yk :)
